# Initialize Genesis Block (node 1) 
`geth --datadir "<project>/<directory>/node1" init genesis.json`

> A **genesis block** is the first **block** of a **block** chain. Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as **block** 0, though very early versions counted it as **block** 1. The**genesis block** is almost always hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its **block**chain.
>
> A **node** is a device on a blockchain network, that is in essence the foundation of the technology, allowing it to function and survive. ... Nodes are often arranged in the structure of trees, known as binary trees. Each cryptocurrency has its own nodes, maintaining the transaction records of that particular token.  
>
> **EIPs** Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. (https://eips.ethereum.org/)

> ## Genesis block Explanation
>
> **mixhash**  A 256-bit hash which proves, combined with the  `nonce`, that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block: the Proof-of-Work (PoW). The combination of  `nonce`  and  `mixhash`  must satisfy a mathematical condition described in the Yellowpaper, 4.3.4. Block Header Validity, (44). It allows to verify that the Block has really been cryptographically mined, thus, from this aspect, is valid.
>
> **nonce**  A 64-bit hash, which proves, combined with the mix-hash, that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block: the Proof-of-Work (PoW). The combination of  `nonce`  and  `mixhash`  must satisfy a mathematical condition described in the Yellowpaper, 4.3.4. Block Header Validity, (44), and allows to verify that the Block has really been cryptographically mined and thus, from this aspect, is valid. The  `nonce`  is the cryptographically secure mining proof-of-work that proves beyond reasonable doubt that a particular amount of computation has been expended in the determination of this token value. (Yellowpager, 11.5. Mining Proof-of-Work).
>
> **difficulty**  A scalar value corresponding to the difficulty level applied during the  `nonce`  discovering of this block. It defines the mining Target, which can be calculated from the previous block’s difficulty level and the timestamp. The higher the difficulty, the statistically more calculations a Miner must perform to discover a valid block. This value is used to control the Block generation time of a Blockchain, keeping the Block generation frequency within a target range. On the test network, we keep this value low to avoid waiting during tests, since the discovery of a valid Block is required to execute a transaction on the Blockchain.
>
> **alloc**  Allows defining a list of pre-filled wallets. That’s an Ethereum specific functionality to handle the “Ether pre-sale” period. Since we can mine local Ether quickly, we don’t use this option.
>
> **coinbase**  The 160-bit address to which all rewards (in Ether) collected from the successful mining of this block have been transferred. They are a sum of the mining reward itself and the Contract transaction execution refunds. Often named “beneficiary” in the specifications, sometimes “etherbase” in the online documentation. This can be anything in the Genesis Block since the value is set by the setting of the Miner when a new Block is created.
>
> **timestamp**  A scalar value equal to the reasonable output of Unix  `time()`  function at this block inception. This mechanism enforces a homeostasis in terms of the time between blocks. A smaller period between the last two blocks results in an increase in the difficulty level and thus additional computation required to find the next valid block. If the period is too large, the difficulty, and expected time to the next block, is reduced. The timestamp also allows verifying the order of block within the chain (Yellowpaper, 4.3.4. (43)).
> 
> **parentHash**  The Keccak 256-bit hash of the entire parent block header (including its  `nonce`  and  `mixhash`). Pointer to the parent block, thus effectively building the chain of blocks. In the case of the Genesis block, and only in this case, it’s  `0`.
>
> **extraData**  An optional free, but max. 32-byte long space to conserve smart things for ethernity. :)
>
> **gasLimit**  A scalar value equal to the current chain-wide limit of Gas expenditure per block. High in our case to avoid being limited by this threshold during tests. Note: this does not indicate that we should not pay attention to the Gas consumption of our Contracts.

# Enable Blockchain RPC (node 1) 
`geth --datadir "<project>/<directory>/node1" --networkid 5432 --rpc --rpcport 5000 --rpcaddr 127.0.0.1 --rpccorsdomain "*" console 2>console.log`


> - Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.

> - rpccorsdomain - allow your web browser to get access to your local Ethereum node

> There are basically three important ports. The first is discovery port, and other two are listener ports:

> **Discovery port**: (default is 30303). This port is used for connecting to other geth nodes.  
**RPC port**: (default is 8545). This port is used to send JSON-rpc requests to the geth client.  
**Websocket port**: (default is 8546) You can connect to geth client using websockets.

>All of them are independent process and hence cannot be run on same ports.
